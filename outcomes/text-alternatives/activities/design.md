## Design responsibilities

- Work with content authors and developers to provide text alternatives for non-text content.

- Share what the non-text content you designed is supposed to convey to users.

## Designer tips

- Provide a place in your design for text alternatives for images and media. For example, you might need:
    - Text along with icons and graphical buttons
    - Captions and descriptions for complex graphs

## User testing and meaningful involvement

- As early as possible in your project, learn the basics of how people with disabilities use the web by reading online resources and watching videos.
